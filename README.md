# Plans for the future
### Somethings I'm in the process of learning to implement include:
- Learning to use the model translate PDF documents them into CSV files.
- Implement caching with Redis to reduce load time and decrease calls to the S3 bucket.
- Develop a check system to detect if a user has already uploaded the same PDF twice to reduce redundant storage of the same file.
- Markup tools to annotate PDFs.
